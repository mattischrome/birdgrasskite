This is the next post. I have experimented with adding two tags and two categories.

How do I comment out a line in Emacs? I used to have how written down on my whiteboard but can't seem to find it in the Doom Emacs menus anymore!

I will also need to work out how to show tags and categories if I am to continue using the console theme.
